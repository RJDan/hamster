    Your time tracking habits will be dictated by your reason for
    collecting the data. What is that you want to do with the data? Is it plain
    curiosity, or a work requirement? And at what level of detail are you
    interested in the results?

<p class="p">A suggested pace is to have 5 to 30 activities per day.</p>
<p class="p">
    The intention of <span class="app">Time Tracker</span> is to avoid micro-tracking so that
    one does not turn out spending more time on tracking than doing the
    activities! However, tracking in insufficient detail could result in
    there being no data which is useful to you a month later.

<p class="p">
    For simple activities that don't have a project, use the action as the
    <span class="gui">activity</span> name and the <span class="gui">category</span> for the wider context. For
    example: <span class="input">lunch@work</span>.
</p>
<p class="p">
For more sophisticated tracking try to caption your activity in one or two
words ("tree house", "project x", or similar) and use that caption in the
<span class="gui">activity</span> field.
Use the <span class="gui">category</span> to describe the activity in it's wider context -
is it private or work, or something else?
Finally, use <span class="gui">tags</span> to describe your actual action - is it reading
or constructing, writing or painting.
</p>
<p class="p">This approach will alow you to see how much reading you have done through
all your projects (by tag), how much time you have spent in your hobbies
(by category), and how much time of all your work in project x you have spent
analysing (by activity and tag)

<li class="list"><p class="p">Name activities so that they can be easily distinguished from each
    other. Activity name is also the only information that appears in the
    panel.  Will you be able to determine what you are working on just
    by looking at the activity name?
    </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Keep your list of categories small (say, 3 to 7) and pick ones that
    are unlikely to change over time. Also, keep them generic. For example:
    "work", "private", "misc".
    </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Use the description field for short-term information like
    reference numbers. The search in the <span class="gui">Overview</span> window also
    looks in the description field, so finding activities where you mention
    the specific reference number will be as simple as typing it in the
    search box and pressing <span class="key"><kbd>Enter</kbd></span>.
    </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Activities and tags can come and go as necessary. Once you think
    that you are done with an activity for good, remove it so that it doesn't
    pop up in the auto-complete any more. Don't worry: the facts (activities in
    the log) will not be deleted. This is just the "operational list".
